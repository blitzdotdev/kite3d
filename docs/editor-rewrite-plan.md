# The Kite3D editor rewrite

Revision 3, 2026-09-14. This is a plan you mark: every section ends with a `[ ]` line, and each open decision has its own. Edit any sentence you disagree with; the passes get briefed from this file. The code blocks are the shape the passes must produce, written against the real upstream files and our real server, so a pass can start from them. Your two notes on revision 2 are folded in and quoted where they land (sections 4.2 and 10).

Paths: `packages/editor` is the upstream editor (repalash/threepipe-blueprint-editor at 7fac408) as it sits in `~/kite3d`; `packages/kite3d` and `packages/engine` are ours after the cleanup (#30 on the old repository). Line numbers refer to those trees. Lines of the deleted project hub refer to the old repository at `f87b8c6^`, the commit before the cleanup.

## 0. The rule

Every line in the new editor is upstream's unless one of five reasons forces a change: the local dev server owns the file system; the simplifications that fall out of watching the file system and treating the editor as a pure client; agent-editable glTF text instead of GLB; one `createGame` so embedding a game is easy; a bug fix or a better abstraction. That is the whole rule. Anything else needs a line here and your mark.

A second rule, yours on 2026-09-14, covers everything that goes: no legacy support. A deleted feature leaves no trace in code, docs, comments, tests or changelogs, as if it never existed. The test is `rg` for the feature's names across the repository: zero hits. Games that used a deleted export migrate on their side. This file is the one exception, because it is the list of what goes, and it leaves the repository when the rewrite ships; its history stays in git.

- [x] Accept the rule (accepted 2026-09-14)

## 1. Why a restart and not a cleanup

Let me start with the number that decided this. Three audits compared our tree against upstream and against the five reasons. About 80 percent of the editor diff, 80 percent of the CLI package and 20 percent of the engine fell outside the reasons. Deleting in place would have converged to the same core, but with residue, and with every upstream helper that had been rewritten staying rewritten. Worse, our editor history started on 2026-09-09 with a file copy, so upstream could never be merged again.

A restart keeps upstream's code as upstream wrote it and swaps only the layer that touched the browser file system. The helpers we had thrown away come back for free: `ScriptUtil`, `PlayModeHelper` with pause, `ProjectSettingsManager` with add and remove of scripts and plugins, `EditPreviewHelper`, `AssetTracker`. And the fork has history, so `git merge upstream/master` keeps working.

The kite3d and engine packages are different. They are new code with no upstream, their justified cores are small and known, and the cleanup already stripped the rest. They carry over as they are, plus the project hub that section 10 brings back from history.

- [x] Accept the restart (accepted 2026-09-14)

## 2. The repository

This part is done. `~/kite3d` is the new monorepo and will become master of the kite3d repository. Your call on the push: nothing goes to GitHub until the rewrite is proven locally; then `main` here is force-pushed over `main` of blitzdotdev/kite3d, after the old `main` is kept there as a branch named `old-main` so nothing is lost. Tags and the `next` branch are untouched by that push.

```
~/kite3d  (branch main)

                          │
                          └──► main    (the rewrite; `git merge upstream/master` when he fixes something)
```

Nothing builds yet. The editor's `package.json` still points at upstream's `file:../threepipe` link, and the deletions of section 3 have not run. That is step 1 of section 14.

- [x] Accept the layout: one monorepo, five packages, upstream's branch kept as a mirror (accepted 2026-09-14)
- [x] The push: prove it locally first, then force over blitzdotdev/kite3d `main`, keeping the old main as `old-main` (decided 2026-09-14).
- [x] Fork point: head 7fac408 (built on it, 2026-09-14).

## 3. What goes from upstream

Upstream carried a whole second product inside the editor: an MCP bridge with a WebSocket server and two chat tabs, a browser file system layer with IndexedDB, a service worker that served project modules, a directory picker welcome flow, a single-file mode for opening one GLB without a project, and templates that bootstrapped a project on first open. None of it survives contact with a dev server that owns the folder.

The list, all of it with no importer left once the adapter of section 4 and the picker of section 10 exist:

```
src/utils/ai/, AIAgentTab.tsx, AIMCPTab.tsx      MCP bridge and the chat tabs                    2,054 lines
src/utils/BrowserFileStore.ts, FetchProxy.ts, FileTracker.ts, fsImporter.ts, public/fs-sw.js,
    resolveNameConflict.ts, the IndexedDB half of project.ts, the idb dependency
                                                  the browser file system and the service worker
src/utils/fsApi.ts: queryHandlePerm (55 to 69) and the BroadcastChannel in AnotherFSHelper (80)
                                                  the rest of the file stays; it is the seam of section 4
src/components/Welcome*.tsx, WelcomeScreen.scss, utils/projectActions.tsx, refreshProjectQueryState.ts
                                                  the directory picker, 953 lines; section 10 replaces it
src/components/SaveFileButton.tsx, UseSaveFile.tsx, data/EmptyProjectSettings.ts,
    saveFileAdHoc (ViewerInstanceManager.ts:466) and saveSceneAdHoc (1003)
                                                  single-file mode; UseSaveFile.tsx:76 is the only caller
src/data/projectTemplates.ts, AgentsMdTemplate.md, GitignoreTemplate.txt
                                                  bootstrap on open; kite3d init owns it          ~850
project.ts buildProjectBundleCode, player.ts, public/player.html
                                                  the published bundle; createGame is the runtime
src/utils/importMaps.ts, importmap-vite-plugin, es-module-shims in index.html
                                                  the server injects the import map
src/utils/SandboxPlugin.ts, reportWebVitals.ts, EditorStructure.ts, GridMaterial.ts,
    UseRenderingTrace.tsx, HtmlUiComponent.example.ts and .md
                                                  dead upstream too
src/components/MemoryTab.tsx                      shows the FileTracker stash
backend/, scripts/upload-r2.mjs, packages/mcp-bridge/, tests/, .github/
                                                  not the editor package
```

What stays even though it looks browser-shaped: `fsApi.ts` minus the two items above (its `getDirHandle`, `getFileHandle`, `writeFileHandle` and `AnotherFSHelper` are the helpers every save goes through), `AssetTracker` (the in-memory asset registry; it imports by URL through the importer and never touches a handle), `ScriptUtil` and `modules.ts` (section 7 changes one function), `PlayModeHelper` (section 6), `ProjectSettingsManager`, `EditPreviewHelper`, `EditorFeatures`, the tsdb Library client (section 9), and upstream's thumbnails and save backups, which now land under `.kite3d/`.

- [x] Accept the deletions (accepted 2026-09-14)

## 4. Feature: the dev server as the file system

Here is the one idea this whole section rests on. Upstream never calls the browser file system directly; it calls a handle. Every read and write goes through `FileSystemDirectoryHandle` and `FileSystemFileHandle`, and I counted exactly which members, in the tree that remains after section 3:

```
getFileHandle / getDirectoryHandle   34 call sites     project.ts, ScriptUtil.ts, ViewerInstanceManager.ts,
                                                       ProjectSettingsManager.ts, FilesPanel.tsx
getFile()                            11 call sites     six files
entries()                             1 call site      AssetsProvider.ts:40, directoryToManifest
createWritable().write().close()      1 call site      fsApi.ts:72, writeFileHandle (the two in saveFileAdHoc go with it)
isSameEntry()                         1 call site      ScriptUtil.ts:635, the FileSystemObserver branch, which goes (section 7)
queryPermission / requestPermission   3 call sites     fsApi.ts:56, project.ts:151, ViewerInstanceManager.ts:612
kind, name                            reads only
never                                 removeEntry, values, keys, resolve, seek, truncate, showSaveFilePicker
```

If two small classes implement the first four rows over HTTP, every upstream helper runs unchanged. That is the seam, and it is why the rewrite is small.

### 4.1 The transport

`DevServerSource` is carried over from the old editor and trimmed to what the handles and the screenshot need. It is the only file that knows the routes.

```ts
// packages/editor/src/devserver/DevServerSource.ts
export interface ProjectFileEntry { path: string; size: number; sha256: string; mtime: number }
export interface ProjectReadResult { bytes: Uint8Array; sha256: string }
export type ProjectEvent =
    | { type: 'change' | 'add' | 'unlink'; path: string; sha256?: string; client?: string }
    | { type: 'command'; id: string; command: 'screenshot'; options: { name?: string; width?: number; height?: number } }

export class ProjectConflictError extends Error {
    constructor(readonly path: string, readonly sha256?: string) { super(`${path} changed on disk`) }
}

export class DevServerSource {
    readonly clientId = crypto.randomUUID()
    private readonly token: string
    constructor(readonly base = new URL('/', location.href)) {
        const token = new URL(location.href).searchParams.get('t')
        if (!token) throw new Error('Open the tokenized URL printed by kite3d dev.')
        this.token = token
    }
    private headers(extra: Record<string, string> = {}) {
        return { 'X-Kite3D-Token': this.token, 'X-Kite3D-Client': this.clientId, ...extra }
    }
    async list(): Promise<ProjectFileEntry[]> { return this.json('/api/files') }
    async listDirectories(): Promise<string[]> { return (await this.json<{ directories: string[] }>('/api/directories')).directories }
    async createDirectory(path: string) { await this.json('/api/directories', { method: 'POST', body: JSON.stringify({ path }), headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }) }
    async state(): Promise<{ hub?: true; name?: string; versions?: Record<string, string> }> { return this.json('/api/state') }
    async read(path: string, sha256?: string): Promise<ProjectReadResult> {
        // ?v=<sha> makes the URL unique per version; no-cache revalidates against the ETag when the sha is unknown
        const res = await fetch(this.fileUrl(path, sha256), { headers: this.headers(), cache: 'no-cache' })
        if (!res.ok) throw new Error(`Cannot read ${path}: ${res.status}`)
        return { bytes: new Uint8Array(await res.arrayBuffer()), sha256: (res.headers.get('etag') || '').replace(/"/g, '') }
    }
    async write(path: string, bytes: Blob | Uint8Array | string, ifMatch: string | '*'): Promise<{ sha256: string }> {
        const res = await fetch(this.fileUrl(path), {
            method: 'PUT', body: bytes,
            headers: this.headers({ 'Content-Type': 'application/octet-stream', 'If-Match': ifMatch === '*' ? '*' : `"${ifMatch}"` }),
        })
        if (res.status === 412) throw new ProjectConflictError(path, (await res.json()).sha256)
        if (!res.ok) throw new Error(`Cannot write ${path}: ${res.status}`)
        return res.json()
    }
    async delete(path: string) {
        const res = await fetch(this.fileUrl(path), { method: 'DELETE', headers: this.headers() })
        if (!res.ok && res.status !== 404) throw new Error(`Cannot delete ${path}: ${res.status}`)
    }
    events(listener: (event: ProjectEvent) => void): () => void {
        const source = new EventSource(`/api/events?client=${encodeURIComponent(this.clientId)}`)
        for (const type of ['change', 'add', 'unlink', 'command'] as const) {
            source.addEventListener(type, (e) => listener({ type, ...JSON.parse((e as MessageEvent).data) }))
        }
        return () => source.close()
    }
    fileUrl(path: string, sha256?: string, revision?: number): string {
        const url = new URL('/files/' + path.split('/').map(encodeURIComponent).join('/'), this.base)
        if (sha256) url.searchParams.set('v', sha256)
        if (revision) url.searchParams.set('r', String(revision))
        return url.href
    }
    async screenshotResult(id: string, png: Blob) {
        await fetch(`/api/screenshot/${id}`, { method: 'POST', body: png, headers: this.headers({ 'Content-Type': 'image/png' }) })
    }
    private async json<T>(path: string, init: RequestInit = {}): Promise<T> {
        const res = await fetch(new URL(path, this.base), { ...init, headers: this.headers(init.headers as Record<string, string>) })
        if (!res.ok) throw new Error(`${path}: ${res.status}`)
        return res.json()
    }
}
```

The server side is unchanged from the cleanup branch: `GET /api/files` returns `{path, size, sha256, mtime}` entries, `GET /files/<path>` answers with an `ETag` and rewrites relative imports in `.m?js` files when `?v=` is present, `PUT /files/<path>` requires `If-Match` and writes through a temp file and a rename, `GET /api/events` is Server-Sent Events with a 150 ms coalescing window per path. The token is accepted from the header, from the per-port cookie the first page load sets, or from `?t=` on GET, which is what keeps `<script type=module>` and `viewer.load` working without a header.

One server change, your call on 2026-09-14: the watcher ignores `.kite3d`. Today one predicate, `isIncludedPath` (`server.ts:537`), gates the listing, the file routes and the watcher, and it lets `.kite3d` through because the editor keeps thumbnails and save backups there. The listing and the routes keep that exception. The watcher gets a stricter one, so screenshots, `dev.json`, backups and a detached server's `dev.log` no longer become events for every tab.

### 4.2 The handles

> Your note on revision 2: "remove never used and simplify the File System Access API"

Agreed, and it changes the shape of the adapter. Revision 2 mimicked the browser interfaces, which meant pretending to implement members nobody calls, and a cast at the boundary so TypeScript would accept the pretence. That is a type that lies. The adapter now has its own two interfaces with exactly the members of the table above, and upstream's type annotations move to them. That is a mechanical rename of 22 mentions in six files (`fsApi.ts` 5, `FilesPanel.tsx` 5, `project.ts` 4, `ScriptUtil.ts` 3, `AssetsProvider.ts` 3, `ViewerInstanceManager.ts` 2) and no logic change.

Three ceremonies go with the browser: permissions, because a dev server has nothing to grant (`queryHandlePerm` and its two remaining callers, `project.ts:151 to 157` inside `resolveFile` and `ViewerInstanceManager.ts:612`); the writable stream, because a write is one PUT (`writeFileHandle` at `fsApi.ts:71 to 75` becomes one line); and `isSameEntry`, because the only comparison lives in the observer branch that section 7 deletes.

```ts
// packages/editor/src/devserver/handles.ts
import { DevServerSource, ProjectFileEntry, ProjectEvent } from './DevServerSource'

// The whole contract. Upstream calls nothing else on a handle.
export interface ProjectDirectoryHandle {
    readonly kind: 'directory'
    readonly name: string
    readonly path: string
    getDirectoryHandle(name: string, options?: { create?: boolean }): Promise<ProjectDirectoryHandle>
    getFileHandle(name: string, options?: { create?: boolean }): Promise<ProjectFileHandle>
    entries(): AsyncIterableIterator<[string, ProjectDirectoryHandle | ProjectFileHandle]>
}

    directories = new Set<string>()
    based = new Map<string, string>()                // the sha this tab last read or wrote, per path; events never touch it
    constructor(private readonly source: DevServerSource) {}
    async refresh() {
        const [files, directories] = await Promise.all([this.source.list(), this.source.listDirectories()])
        this.files = new Map(files.map((f) => [f.path, f]))
        this.directories = new Set(directories)
    }
    apply(event: ProjectEvent) {
        if (event.type === 'unlink') this.files.delete(event.path)
        else if (event.type !== 'command') this.files.set(event.path, { path: event.path, size: 0, sha256: event.sha256 || '', mtime: Date.now() })
    }
    childrenOf(dir: string): Array<[string, 'file' | 'directory']> {
        const prefix = dir ? dir + '/' : ''
        const names = new Map<string, 'file' | 'directory'>()
        for (const path of this.files.keys()) {
            if (!path.startsWith(prefix)) continue
            const rest = path.slice(prefix.length)
            const slash = rest.indexOf('/')
            names.set(slash < 0 ? rest : rest.slice(0, slash), slash < 0 ? 'file' : 'directory')
        }
        for (const d of this.directories) if (d.startsWith(prefix) && !d.slice(prefix.length).includes('/')) names.set(d.slice(prefix.length), 'directory')
        return [...names]
    }
}

const notFound = (name: string) => new DOMException(`${name} not found`, 'NotFoundError')

export class DevServerDirectoryHandle implements ProjectDirectoryHandle {

            this.manifest.directories.add(path)
        }
        return new DevServerDirectoryHandle(path, this.source, this.manifest)
    }
    async getFileHandle(name: string, options: { create?: boolean } = {}) {
        const path = this.child(name)
        if (!this.manifest.files.has(path)) {
            if (!options.create) throw notFound(name)
            const { sha256 } = await this.source.write(path, new Uint8Array(), '*')   // '*' is unconditional; callers check existence first (FilesPanel.tsx:222)
            this.manifest.files.set(path, { path, size: 0, sha256, mtime: Date.now() })
            this.manifest.based.set(path, sha256)
        }
        return new DevServerFileHandle(path, this.source, this.manifest)
    }
    async *entries(): AsyncIterableIterator<[string, DevServerDirectoryHandle | DevServerFileHandle]> {
        for (const [name, kind] of this.manifest.childrenOf(this.path)) {
            const path = this.child(name)
            yield [name, kind === 'directory' ? new DevServerDirectoryHandle(path, this.source, this.manifest) : new DevServerFileHandle(path, this.source, this.manifest)]
        }
    }
}

export class DevServerFileHandle implements ProjectFileHandle {
    readonly kind = 'file' as const
    constructor(readonly path: string, private readonly source: DevServerSource, private readonly manifest: ProjectManifest) {}
    get name() { return this.path.split('/').pop() || '' }
    async getFile(): Promise<File> {
        const { bytes, sha256 } = await this.source.read(this.path, this.manifest.files.get(this.path)?.sha256)
        this.manifest.based.set(this.path, sha256)
        return new File([bytes], this.name, { lastModified: this.manifest.files.get(this.path)?.mtime })
    }
    async write(data: Blob | Uint8Array | string) {
        // The base is what this tab read or wrote, never what it heard from an event. A file this tab
        // never read (a new sidecar) writes unconditionally, which the server spells '*'.
        const { sha256 } = await this.source.write(this.path, data, this.manifest.based.get(this.path) || '*')
        this.manifest.based.set(this.path, sha256)
        this.manifest.files.set(this.path, { ...(this.manifest.files.get(this.path) || { path: this.path, size: 0, mtime: 0 }), sha256, mtime: Date.now() })
    }
}
```

```ts
// packages/editor/src/utils/fsApi.ts, lines 71 to 75 after the change
export async function writeFileHandle(fileHandle: ProjectFileHandle, file: Blob | Uint8Array | string) {
    await fileHandle.write(file)
}
```

Two things to notice. `getFileHandle` without `create` throws a `NotFoundError` DOMException, which is what upstream's `fsApi.ts:29` and `:42` already catch. And a write carries, as `If-Match`, the sha256 this tab last read or wrote for that path, so two editors on one project cannot overwrite each other silently.

Here is the whole conflict story, because the base matters. Editors A and B both loaded the scene at sha S0. A saves: the server compares `If-Match: "S0"` with the file, they agree, it writes, the sha is now S1, and A remembers S1. The server sends `change {path, sha256: S1, client: A}` to every tab; B's listing learns S1, and if B has unsaved edits B is asked whether to reload the disk copy. Say B says no and saves later. B's PUT still carries S0, because the base is what B read, never what B heard. The server answers 412 with the current sha (`server.ts:298 to 300`), and nothing is written. That surfaces as `ProjectConflictError`; the save handler then reads the disk copy and asks: the scene changed on disk, reload it, overwrite it, or cancel? Reload replaces B's copy with A's version, and B's edits are gone. Overwrite sends the same PUT again with the sha the 412 returned, so B's copy lands on disk and A's version is gone; A then gets the change event and its own prompt. Cancel writes nothing and keeps B's copy, and the next save asks again. The old manager (637 to 647) offered reload only; overwrite is your addition, for the case where a human in the editor wants to win over an agent's edit. Two saves at the same instant behave the same way: the server takes them one at a time, the first wins, the second gets the prompt.

### 4.3 How the editor opens

Upstream's `loadProject(meta)` wants a `LoadedProject` with a `handle`. We give it one for the served folder and keep everything after that as upstream wrote it. The first call decides between the picker and a project (section 10).

```
 kite3d dev, 150 ms after any write (editor, agent, Blender, shell)
     └──► SSE  change {path, sha256, client?}   to every tab

 each tab, on the event
   client is me ............ ignore; my base is already the new sha
   anyone else ............. listing[path] = sha256   (base[path] untouched)
       main scene, clean ... reload from disk
       main scene, dirty ... ask "Changed on disk: reload and discard the editor copy?"
       script, package.json, assets.json ... changedFilesQ.push(path)   (section 7 takes it from there)
       a placed asset, or one of its files ... scheduleAssetRefresh(path)   (below)
       anything else ............ the Files panel listing only
```

The two main-scene lines are the one new behaviour in this section, and they are a port of what our editor already did: a scene changed on disk by an agent or by Blender reloads, with a confirm when the editor copy is dirty. Upstream's `refreshChangedFilesQ` takes it from there for scripts, `package.json` and `assets.json`, because its queue already accepts a plain path string (`ScriptUtil.ts:610`, the string branch at 629). `FileSystemObserver`, the two-second poll, the `BroadcastChannel` and `FetchProxy` are gone; asset URLs under `/kite3d/` resolve through the engine's `createProjectAssetURLModifier` on the viewer's importer, the same call `createGame` makes.

#### A changed asset file

The gap you asked me to close: a Blender re-export of `assets/tree.glb` did not enter the viewer live, not in the old editor and not in revision 3. You saw the new mesh after the next scene reload.

Upstream already has the machinery; it only lacks the trigger. `AssetTracker` keeps a registry keyed by rootPath, the URL a placed asset stores in the scene (`/kite3d/@<id>/f.glb`, or `/kite3d/<path>` before the asset has an id, from `toAssetIdPath` at `ViewerInstanceManager.ts:1452`). Every placed instance subscribes to its entry (`subsToAsset`, 1529). `refreshFromRegistry(key, {importedFile})` (`AssetTracker.ts:304`) re-imports the asset from a `File`, then runs `_objectRefresh` (379) on each subscriber: the instance's children are swapped for the new mesh, and its own transform, name and visibility survive because they sit in its override list. Upstream fires this when you re-open the asset's file from the Files panel (1404 and 1430). The change event becomes the second trigger.

```ts
// packages/editor/src/utils/ViewerInstanceManager.ts, called from the event listener of section 8
private assetRefreshTimers = new Map<string, ReturnType<typeof setTimeout>>()

private scheduleAssetRefresh(path: string) {
    const owner = this.assetOwning(path)      // the assets.json entry whose path is this file, or whose files list it,
    if (!owner) return                        // or the .gltf next to a .bin of the same name; else not a placed asset
    clearTimeout(this.assetRefreshTimers.get(owner.path))
    this.assetRefreshTimers.set(owner.path, setTimeout(() => {   // Blender writes .gltf, .bin and textures within a few ms: one refresh
        this.assetRefreshTimers.delete(owner.path)
        void this.refreshAsset(owner.path).catch((error) => this.reportError(error))
    }, 250))
}

private async refreshAsset(assetPath: string) {
    const project = this.loadedProject!
    const key = await this.toAssetIdPath({ path: assetPath })               // upstream, unchanged
    const tracker = this.get().assetManager.tracker
    if (!tracker.registry[key]) return                                      // on disk, never placed: nothing to refresh
    const file = await resolveFile(assetPath, project.path, project.handle)  // GET /files/<path>?v=<new sha>
    await tracker.refreshFromRegistry(key, { importedFile: file }).pms       // every placed instance updates in place
}
```

```
 Blender saves assets/tree.gltf + assets/tree.bin
   ─► two change events, a few ms apart
   ─► assetOwning: both belong to assets/tree.gltf
   ─► one timer, 250 ms after the last event
   ─► resolveFile reads the new bytes through the handle (the sha from the event is in the URL)
   ─► tracker.refreshFromRegistry('/kite3d/@tree/f.gltf', {importedFile})
        ├─ instance 1: children swapped, its transform kept
        ├─ instance 2: same
        └─ instance 3: same
   the scene file is untouched: instances reference the asset by id, so there is nothing to save
```

Play does not stop for a refresh; the instances update in the running scene. What this does not cover: a texture that a scene material references directly, not through an asset entry. It refreshes on the next scene reload. That case gets its own line when it bites.

Evidence: place `tree.glb` three times with different transforms; copy a different mesh over `assets/tree.glb` from a shell; within a second the three instances show the new mesh at their own transforms (before and after screenshots, viewed); Save writes a byte-identical `main.scene.gltf`.

Lifecycle of the pieces: one `DevServerSource` and one `ProjectManifest` per page, made in `main.tsx`. The SSE subscription opens in `ViewerInstanceManager.initialize()` and closes in `dispose()`. Handles are values, created on demand, and hold no state; the per-path base sha lives in the manifest. Nothing caches `File` objects.

Evidence for the pass: open a scratch project headless; Files lists every file and empty folder; New Folder, New Script and New Scene create files on disk; a script edited from a shell shows in the editor within a second and its component reloads; an external edit of the open scene prompts and reloads; two editors on the same project, a save in one appears in the other and a stale save gets the conflict message; no request without the token succeeds. Screenshots per case, viewed.

- [x] Accept the asset refresh of 4.4 (accepted 2026-09-14)
- [x] The watcher ignores `.kite3d` (decided 2026-09-14).

## 5. Feature: glTF text scenes

Upstream saves `assets/main.scene.glb`, a binary. Our rule is a text file an agent can edit with a script: pretty JSON, stable ids, a sibling `.bin`, images under `assets/textures/`. The engine already has the serializer and the parsers; the editor just has to call them where upstream calls the binary exporter.

```ts
// packages/editor/src/utils/ViewerInstanceManager.ts, exportScene (upstream 868 to 941), the changed middle
import { serializeSceneGltf } from '@kite3d/engine'

const serialized = await serializeSceneGltf(viewer, { scenePath: project.mainScene })
// serialized.gltf   Uint8Array, the pretty JSON with stable key order
// serialized.files  [{path: 'assets/main.scene.bin', bytes}, {path: 'assets/textures/<sha>.png', bytes}, ...]
for (const f of serialized.files) await this.fsHelper.writeFile(project.handle, f.path, new File([f.bytes], f.path.split('/').pop()!))
const staleBin = project.mainScene.replace(/\.gltf$/i, '.bin')
if (!serialized.files.some((f) => f.path === staleBin) && manifest.files.has(staleBin)) await this.source.delete(staleBin)
return { file: new File([serialized.gltf], project.mainScene.split('/').pop()!, { type: 'model/gltf+json' }), preview }
```

```ts
// loadImport (upstream 1383 to 1450), the main-scene branch
const url = this.source.fileUrl(project.mainScene, manifest.files.get(project.mainScene)?.sha256)
const root = await v.load(url, { importAsModelRoot: true, importedFile })   // the bytes the handle already read
// placed asset instances resolve through upstream's AssetTracker on processRaw; the editor does not use the
// engine's RuntimeNestedAssetLoader, which has no refresh subscriptions and would be a second owner of the job
this.restoreEditCamera(root)                              // the scene's defaultCamera into the edit camera, port of the old editor
this.savedSceneHash = await sha256(await serializeSceneGltf(v, { scenePath: project.mainScene }).then((s) => s.gltf))
```

Eight small bridges in upstream code make the format ours: `settingsKey` becomes `kite3d` and `assetUrlPrefix` becomes `/kite3d/` (`project.ts:6,7`, and the dot directory becomes `.kite3d/` by itself); the six `.scene.glb` checks become `.scene.gltf` (`project.ts:12,244`; `ViewerInstanceManager.ts:621,1403,1414,1768`; `projectUtils.ts:32`; `FilesPanel.tsx:285,507`); `parsePackageJsonSettings` (`project.ts:240`) delegates to the engine's `parsePackageJsonSettingsConfig`, so `kite3d.viewer` keeps all thirteen fields and plugin strings parse the same way at Play and in a published game; `assets.json` entries keep the engine shape `{path, files?}`; asset ids use the readable rule instead of a UUID in `addIdToAssetsManifest` (`ViewerInstanceManager.ts:792`); bare module specifiers follow the engine rule, a key in `package.json.dependencies`.

```
Save
  exportScene ─► serializeSceneGltf(viewer) ─► gltf + sidecars
       │                                        │
       │  PUT assets/main.scene.bin             │  PUT assets/textures/<sha>.png
       │  DELETE assets/main.scene.bin  (only when no buffer references it any more)
       └► PUT assets/main.scene.gltf   If-Match: "<sha of the last load or save>"
  savedSceneHash = sha256(gltf)          a clean scene stays clean after reload

Load
  GET /files/assets/main.scene.gltf?v=<sha>  ─► viewer.load(importAsModelRoot)
  nestedAssets.loadObjectDependencies         ─► each node with userData.rootPath imports its asset once and clones
  restoreEditCamera                           ─► edit camera = scene defaultCamera
  savedSceneHash                              ─► dirty flag false
```

Evidence: save a scene with three boxes and one image texture; the `.gltf` is pretty JSON with a sibling `.bin` and the image under `assets/textures/`; a second save writes byte-identical files; an agent script edit to a node's translation shows after the external-change reload; a hidden object survives the round trip.

## 6. Feature: Play on the edit viewer, with pause and inspection

Upstream's play mode is the one we lost and want back: it snapshots the scene, starts the clock and the components on the same scene graph, pauses by stopping the clock, lets you click any object in the frozen world, and reloads the snapshot on stop. Our runtime, `createGame`, boots a separate viewer from files on disk, which is right for an embedded game and wrong for the editor. The fix is to split `createGame` so the editor can run the second half on its own viewer.

```ts
// packages/engine/src/runtime/createGame.ts, after the split
export interface StartGameOptions { base: string; onError?: (error: unknown) => void }
export interface RunningGame { stop(): Promise<void> }

export async function startGame(viewer: ThreeViewer, project: RuntimeProject, options: StartGameOptions): Promise<RunningGame> {
    await registerProjectScripts(viewer, project, options)     // skips modules already registered on this viewer
    await registerProjectPlugins(viewer, project, options)
    viewer.timeline.reset(); viewer.timeline.start()
    viewer.getPlugin(EntityComponentPlugin)!.start()
    const physics = viewer.getPlugin(CannonPhysicsPlugin); if (physics) physics.running = true
    const main = await import(/* @vite-ignore */ new URL(project.packageJson.main || './main.js', options.base).href)
    const cleanup = await main.main?.({ viewer })
    return {
        async stop() {
            await cleanup?.()
            if (physics) physics.running = false
            viewer.getPlugin(EntityComponentPlugin)!.stop()
            viewer.timeline.stop(); viewer.timeline.reset()
        },
    }
}

export async function createGame(options: CreateGameOptions): Promise<CreatedGame> {
    const project = await loadRuntimeProject(options.base)
    const viewer = createViewer(options, project)                       // the plugin list as today
    viewer.assetManager.importer.addURLModifier(createProjectAssetURLModifier(options.base, project.assetsManifest))
    await registerProjectScripts(viewer, project, options)              // before the scene loads: a component type that is
    await registerProjectPlugins(viewer, project, options)              // unknown at load time stays a dead placeholder in threepipe
    const nested = new RuntimeNestedAssetLoader(viewer, options.onError)
    const root = await viewer.load(new URL(project.mainScene, options.base).href, { importAsModelRoot: true })
    await nested.loadObjectDependencies(root); await nested.waitForPending()
    const running = await startGame(viewer, project, options)          // registers nothing new here; it skips what the viewer has
    return { viewer, project, dispose: async () => { await running.stop(); nested.dispose(); viewer.dispose() } }
}
```

One order matters, and the engine pass measured it: the project's modules must be registered before the scene loads. threepipe's entity plugin creates a placeholder for a component type it does not know at load time and never swaps it for the real one when the type arrives later, so a scene authored with a `Mover` component ends up with zero movers. `createGame` therefore registers first and loads second, as it did before the split; `startGame` registers too, for the editor's viewer, and skips what is already there. The editor's `ScriptUtil` registers scripts at settings load, before the scene, so on the editor that call is a no-op.

The editor keeps upstream's `PlayModeHelper` and changes three lines. The temp file becomes memory, which upstream's code already half does: `exportScene('running', false, 'gltf')` at line 57 produces text glTF and keeps it at line 70; the `resolveFile` fallback at 164 goes. Where upstream called `EntityComponentPlugin.start()` after `timeline.start()` (lines 103 to 108), it calls `startGame`, and `stopRunMode` calls `stop()`.

```ts
// packages/editor/src/utils/PlayModeHelper.ts, the changed lines
manager.features.enable('physics', 'PlayingMode')
this.running = await startGame(manager.get(), manager.runtimeProject(), { base: '/files/', onError: manager.reportError })
// ...
await this.running?.stop()
manager.features.disable('physics', 'PlayingMode')
```

```
                Run                              Pause

                             │  Stop                    ▲
                             └──────────────────────────┘

 Edit     editPreview off: widgets and gizmo visible, picker on, clock stopped
 Running  snapshot held in memory, editPreview on, physics on, clock running, picker off
 Paused   clock stopped: no component update(), no physics step, picker on, gizmo works
 Stop     unload, reload the snapshot, reselect by uuid, editPreview off, dirty flag as before
```

The pause rule is the one thing to add to the engine, from issue #23: a paused frame runs no component `update()` and steps no physics. If the entity plugin or the physics plugin keep stepping with the timeline stopped, they get gated on `timeline.running`. Everything else is upstream's helper doing what it did in 2024. Disk is never touched by Play or Stop; edits made while paused are discarded at Stop, which is the upstream behaviour too.

Evidence: a scene with a physics box high above a ground plane and a script component that moves another box; Play shows both moving; Pause freezes them (two screenshots a second apart, near-zero diff); click the falling box while paused, the Inspector shows it, drag it with the gizmo, resume, it continues from there; Stop restores the pre-Play frame (diff against the pre-Play screenshot) and the file on disk is byte-identical; a published game still boots through `createGame` in a headless page.

## 7. Feature: project modules loaded by URL

Upstream reads a script's text through a handle, rewrites its relative imports with regular expressions (`modules.ts:28 to 76`), hands the text to a service worker, and imports it through `new Function('return import(path)')`. It also keeps a dependency graph so a change to one file reloads only its dependants. All of that existed because a browser cannot import from a directory handle. A dev server can serve modules, and ours already rewrites relative imports inside served `.m?js` files when `?v=` is present. So the loader collapses to one native import.

```ts
// packages/editor/src/utils/modules.ts, loadModules1 replaced
export async function loadModules1(paths: string[], project: LoadedProject) {
    const results: Record<string, unknown> = {}
    for (const path of paths) {
        const url = isDependencyModuleSpecifier(path, project.packageJson)      // the engine rule: a key in dependencies
            ? path
            : project.source.fileUrl(path, project.manifest.files.get(path)?.sha256, project.revision)
        try { results[path] = await import(/* @vite-ignore */ url) }
        catch (error) { results[path] = { __tpModuleError: error } }             // the shape ScriptUtil already handles
    }
    return results
}
```

`ScriptUtil` keeps everything after the import: `refLoadModule` scans exports for `PluginType` and `ComponentType`, matches them to settings, registers with `addPlugin` and `addComponent`, and `scriptFilesChanged` removes and re-registers on a change. The dependency graph goes, and so does the `FileSystemObserver` branch of `refreshChangedFilesQ` (the handle comparison at `ScriptUtil.ts:633 to 641`); the queue only ever holds paths now. Instead of the graph, one page-wide `revision` counter bumps on every module change, so every project module re-imports fresh. Simpler than the graph, and cheap, because a project has a handful of scripts.

Adding a dependency is the one thing that needs a page reload, because the server injects the import map into the page at load. Upstream appended a second import map at runtime, which only works with es-module-shims.

## 8. Feature: the screenshot command

`kite3d screenshot` asks the connected editor for its viewport. The CLI posts to the server, the server broadcasts a `command` event and waits ten seconds, the editor answers with a PNG. The editor side is one listener and one capture, ported from the old manager (`captureScreenshot`, 717 to 754), which forces a render even when the tab is idle and composites the background.

```ts
// packages/editor/src/utils/ViewerInstanceManager.ts, inside initialize()
this.unsubscribe = this.source.events(async (event) => {
    if (event.type === 'command' && event.command === 'screenshot') {
        try { await this.source.screenshotResult(event.id, await this.captureScreenshot(event.options)) }
        catch (error) { this.reportError(error) }
        return
    }
    if (event.client === this.source.clientId) return
    this.manifest.apply(event)
    if (event.path === this.loadedProject?.mainScene) await this.reloadSceneFromDisk()
    else this.scriptUtil.changedFilesQ.push(event.path)
})
```

The headless path of the CLI waits for `window.kite3dProjectLoaded`, which `loadProject` sets when the scene is in. During Play the capture shows the running game, because it is the same viewer.

## 9. Feature: the Library

Upstream's bottom-bar Library lists `asset-cdn.threepipe.org` through its tsdb client and drops models, materials, textures and environments into the scene through `CanvasFileDropHandler` and `AssetTracker`. It stays exactly as it is, dependencies included. Two of our fixes port onto it as diffs (section 11): a drop that lands before its import finishes waits for it instead of dropping nothing, a failed import shows a toast, and a material drop marks the scene dirty.

The dialog we added on top, "apply as object, material or texture, remember my choice", is not ported; upstream applies the drop directly.

- [x] Accept section 9 (accepted 2026-09-14)
- [x] The drop dialog stays out (decided 2026-09-14).

## 10. Feature: the project picker, at `kite3d.dev` and behind `kite3d open`

> Your note on revision 2: "TODO keep project picker, it should be what opens when user runs `npx kite3d open` in a blank terminal (not in project dir). when they run `npx kite3d dev` in a project folder then it should open the project wihthout the picker being shown. Also the picker should use the old monorepo's picker, which allowed user to list all kite3d projects, see which ones are active / not and open them in a new tab."

> Your call on 2026-09-14: "using a CLI `kite3d open` is suboptimal - most ppl don't like to open terminals. ideally i want to be able to type in `kite3d.dev` and just see the project picker page, where i can see all my kite3d projects." The button reads "Open engine". `npx kite3d open` stays. A launcher started at login was the first answer; you called it jank, and the URL scheme below replaced it: "ok do the url scheme. keep it simple".

Some history first, because it explains what this section is not. The old repository had this picker. PR #13 built the CLI half (`bc5f390`: the project index, background servers, the launcher) and PR #12 the editor half (`b35ce75`: the hub page, the welcome dialog, the navbar picker, the worktrees section). The cleanup in #30 deleted the CLI half and its tests but left the editor half in place with nothing to talk to. Your call: none of that code comes back. Both halves are written from scratch against this section, simpler and readable, with comments that say what each part is for. The old commits at `f87b8c6^` are a reference for behaviour only, and the numbers below describe them so the pass knows the size of the job. Two things are new against the old behaviour: a `kite3d://` URL scheme, so a click on `kite3d.dev` starts the launcher, and the hub routes live in every dev server.

Here is the idea in one sentence. A browser page cannot read `~/.kite3d` and cannot start a dev server, so something local must run; the old hub was that thing, and the only problem with it was that a terminal command started it. Let a link start it instead, the way `vscode://` and `figma://` links start those apps, and the terminal disappears from the daily path. Nothing stays resident: the launcher starts on the first click and lives until logout.

### 10.1 The `kite3d://` scheme

> Your note: "can't we just run npx kite3d install when a npx kite3d init is first run in ANY project, one-time procedure per machine. requiring an explict install => likely ppl will forget"

Nobody runs a separate install step, so the registration happens by itself. The first `kite3d init` or `kite3d dev` on a machine installs a copy of the CLI where npx cannot evict it, registers `kite3d://` with the operating system, and prints one line: `Registered kite3d:// so kite3d.dev can open your projects. Undo with npx kite3d install --remove.` `dev` is in the list because a cloned project never runs `init`. The check is the registration itself: if the applet, the `.desktop` file or the registry key is there, nothing happens. When a newer kite3d runs `dev`, it refreshes the copy, so the launcher never falls behind the newest project on the machine. Under `CI=1` nothing is registered. `kite3d install` stays as the by-hand form, for a repair or for `--remove`. The handler does one thing whatever the link says: it runs `kite3d open`.

```
 first npx kite3d init or npx kite3d dev on this machine   (or npx kite3d install by hand)
   ├─ npm install kite3d@<this version> --prefix ~/.kite3d/launcher      a copy npx will not evict
   ├─ macOS    osacompile -o "~/Applications/Kite3D Launcher.app"         a twenty-line applet: on open location, do shell script
   │           CFBundleURLTypes kite3d in its Info.plist, lsregister -f     unsigned and built locally, so no Gatekeeper quarantine
   ├─ Linux    ~/.local/share/applications/kite3d.desktop                  MimeType=x-scheme-handler/kite3d, then xdg-mime default
   └─ Windows  HKCU\Software\Classes\kite3d\shell\open\command             with the URL Protocol value
      the handler line on all three:  /bin/zsh -lc 'exec node ~/.kite3d/launcher/node_modules/kite3d/dist/cli.js open'
      (a login shell, so the user's own node is on PATH; nothing records a binary path)

 npx kite3d install --remove  ─►  deletes the registration and the copy, keeps ~/.kite3d/projects.json
```

`kite3d open` keeps its old meaning, with one check first: if `~/.kite3d/hub.json` names a live launcher it opens that URL and starts nothing; otherwise it starts a detached launcher on `127.0.0.1:4320` (through 4339) as before, waits for `hub.json`, and opens it. Flags stay `--no-open` and `--stop`. There is no `--serve`, nothing starts at login, and there is no idle timeout.

### 10.2 The door at `kite3d.dev`

The landing page gets one button, "Open engine", a link to `kite3d://open`, under a copy-pastable one-liner, `npx -y kite3d init my-game` (0.20.0 is on `latest` since 2026-09-15). Next to the button, one line: "First time here? Run the command above once." Shipped on 2026-09-15 from blitz-cloud, worker `kite3d-landing` on the blitzmen account.

```
 kite3d.dev ─ click "Open engine" ─► <a href="kite3d://open">
   browser   "Open Kite3D Launcher?"  [always allow for kite3d.dev]      once per browser
   OS        runs the registered handler
   handler   kite3d open
   open      hub.json names a live launcher?   yes ─► reuse it    no ─► start one detached, wait for hub.json
   open      opens http://127.0.0.1:4320/?t=<token> in the default browser
   tab       the picker; ?t= sets the per-port cookie, Strict, exactly as on every dev server
```

Because the handler opens the tokenized URL itself, nothing else changes: no cookie relaxation, no pairing page, no CORS, no local-network prompt. A page on the web never talks to the launcher; it only asks the OS to run a program the user installed. The one quirk: the tab opens in the default browser, which may not be the one you clicked in.

The landing page lives in blitz-cloud, so the button is a separate, two-line pull request there.

### 10.3 The picker

The behaviour, in your words and in the old code's terms:

One server class. `kite3d dev` and `kite3d open` start the same server; the difference is whether a project is attached. Every server serves the editor bundle and the hub routes; a server with a project also serves the file routes; `/api/state` answers `{hub: true}` when there is no project. So the launcher is a server without a project, and the navbar picker of any open editor can start and stop the others. The old `createHubServer` goes; `hub.ts` keeps start-or-reuse and stop.

- `kite3d.dev`, "Open engine", or `npx kite3d open`: the picker, forced open, no viewer behind it. Every indexed project grouped by git repository, worktrees under their repository, loose projects below, running ones marked, with Open and Stop, plus New Project and Open Project.
- `npx kite3d dev` in a project folder: that project's server starts (`4321` through 4340), registers in the index, and the editor opens directly. No dialog. The first navbar button shows the same picker on demand, with "this tab" marked.
- Open on a running project opens its URL in a new tab, nothing else. Open on a stopped one spawns `node <project>/node_modules/kite3d/dist/cli.js dev --no-open` detached, or the launcher's own CLI when the project has no install yet (a project created from the picker), waits for `<project>/.kite3d/dev.json`, and opens the URL it finds there. The token travels inside that URL; the new server sets its own per-port cookie on first load.

On tabs, since that is what you said this is really about: the launcher cannot see browser tabs, but every dev server knows its own, because an open tab is one SSE subscriber. So `/api/state` on a dev server gains a `clients` count, the launcher asks each running server with the token from its `dev.json`, and a row reads "running, 2 tabs" or "running, no tab". What no page can do is focus a tab it did not open. Open on a running project is always a new tab on the same server, which is safe: the two tabs stay in sync through the events, and If-Match keeps them from overwriting each other.

Two shapes, one per job: what persists, and what a running server writes. The picker's list is the first shape plus what only the server can know right now.

```ts
// packages/kite3d/src/projectIndex.ts     ~/.kite3d/projects.json: what persists across reboots
export interface ProjectIndex { version: 1; projects: IndexedProject[] }
export interface IndexedProject {
    path: string            // absolute, symlinks resolved; the key
    name: string            // package.json name, or the folder name
    lastOpened: string      // ISO time of the last init, dev, or open through the picker; the sort key
}

// packages/kite3d/src/server.ts           what every running server writes when it listens, and deletes on a clean close
// the launcher writes it to ~/.kite3d/hub.json, because kite3d open must find it without a project;
// a project server writes it to <project>/.kite3d/dev.json. Same shape, two places.
export interface ServerState { pid: number; port: number; url: string; token: string }

// GET /api/hub/projects → ProjectRow[]      the index rows, each with the six things only the server knows right now
export type ProjectRow = IndexedProject & {
    repoRoot: string | null // from git at request time: the root every worktree of the repository shares; null outside git
    branch: string | null   // from git at request time; null when HEAD is detached
    head: string | null     // the short commit when branch is null
    running: boolean        // <path>/.kite3d/dev.json parses and its pid is alive
    tabs: number            // that server's SSE subscribers, asked with its token; 0 when not running
    url?: string            // the tokenized URL to open; only when running
}
```

The picker does the rest in the browser: it groups rows by `repoRoot` (null is the loose list), names a group by the last path segment of `repoRoot`, lists the running rows first, and sorts by `lastOpened`.

The old code had two server shapes, `HubState` and a `DevState` with `origin` and `started_at` on top, because the hub was a second server type. With one server class there is one shape; `origin` was the url without its token, and `started_at` was never read. The old response was a nested object with an `active` list, a `repos` tree and a `loose` list, all built on the server from the same rows; a flat list and a group-by in the picker is less code on both sides.

```
on every server (the launcher is the one without a project)
GET   /api/state                    {hub: true}                     the editor picks hub mode on this
GET   /api/hub/projects             ProjectRow[]                     the index rows plus branch, running, tabs, url
GET   /api/hub/folders?path=        {path, parent, folders: [{name, path, isProject, isRepo}]}   Open Project browser, under $HOME
POST  /api/hub/projects/start       {path} → {url}                   reuse a live dev.json, else spawn and wait 60 s
POST  /api/hub/projects/stop        {path} → {stopped: true}         SIGTERM, 5 s, SIGKILL
POST  /api/hub/projects/create      {parent, name} → {path}          kite3d init, then register
POST  /api/hub/projects/add         {path} → {path}                  register an existing project
errors                              {error: {code, message}}         invalid_request, invalid_path, not_found, conflict, start_failed
```

A project is "running" when its `dev.json` parses and its `pid` answers `kill(pid, 0)`. No heartbeat, no port probe, and no cross-check of the url against the token, since one process writes both from the same two values. A dead pid with a stale file reads as stopped, and the next start overwrites the file. A server that finds a live claim on its project's file leaves it alone, so `kite3d screenshot --headless`, which starts a second server, cannot steal the first one's file.

```
 a project row in the picker

                kite3d dev, or Open in the picker            Stop in the picker, or Ctrl-C in its terminal
   stopped ──────────────────────────────────────► running ───────────────────────────────────────► stopped
   dev.json absent, or its pid dead                dev.json valid, pid alive; "n tabs" from its SSE clients
   Open: POST start, wait, window.open(url)        Open: window.open(url) only, no new process
```

On the editor side, four pieces, written fresh on upstream's welcome dialog: a client module for the seven routes with the token header, the navbar popover, the projects tab (replacing upstream's 48-line IndexedDB recents tab), and a `hubMode` prop on `WelcomeScreenDialog.tsx` (forced open, no escape, no outside click). The mode switch is the `if (state.hub)` in section 4.3. Upstream's directory-picker files of section 3 are what this replaces. For size, the old versions were 262, 104 and 220 lines.

Two things the fresh code does not repeat from the old, because the old was heavier than its job. First, no lock files: the old code had three (`projects.lock`, `hub-start.lock`, `dev-detach.lock`), each with a 60-second staleness rule and a polling loop. The index is written through a temp file and a rename, so a lost race costs one registration that the next `dev` repeats; two launchers at the same instant land on two ports, and both work. Second, a start on an already-running project also refreshes `lastOpened`, so the field name does not lie.

Evidence, all headless: a first `kite3d init` on this Mac with no `~/.kite3d/launcher` builds the applet, prints the line, and `lsregister -dump` lists the `kite3d` scheme; a second `init` prints nothing and changes nothing; a `dev` from a newer kite3d refreshes the copy; running the handler line by hand with `--no-open` starts the launcher and writes `hub.json`; the click itself is yours to try, since a real click opens your browser; the picker lists two scratch projects, one running, grouped under their repository with the worktree branch names; Open on the stopped one writes its `dev.json`, returns its URL, and a new page loads the editor; Open on the running one spawns nothing; the tab count goes from 1 to 2 when a second tab opens; Stop turns the row grey; `npx kite3d open` with the launcher running opens the URL and starts no second process; `kite3d dev` in a project opens the editor with no dialog, and the navbar button shows the picker with that tab marked. Screenshots viewed. The Linux and Windows registrations are verified when a machine is at hand, not in this pass.

- [x] Accept section 10: the `kite3d://` scheme registered by the first `init` or `dev` on a machine, "Open engine" as a scheme link, the hub routes on every server, tab counts, `npx kite3d open` kept (accepted 2026-09-14)
- [x] Written from scratch, simpler, commented; no lock files (decided 2026-09-14).
- [x] The by-hand command is `kite3d install` and `kite3d install --remove` (decided 2026-09-14).
- [ ] Later, not in this rewrite: the hosted picker, rendered on `kite3d.dev` itself for a paired browser, Chrome first. It needs CORS on the launcher, a pairing step that hands the page the token, and Chrome's one-time local-network prompt; Safari blocks the fetch, so the link stays as the fallback.
- [ ] Later, not in this rewrite: a browser extension with a native messaging host, a picker in the toolbar with no server at all.

} }
```

- [x] Accept section 11 (accepted 2026-09-14)

## 12. Carry-over from kite3d and the engine

After #30 the CLI is `init`, `dev` with `--no-open` and `--port`, `screenshot`, `skills`, and `publish`, which prints the path of `packages/kite3d/skills/publish/SKILL.md`, a thirteen-step procedure an agent follows with curl. Section 10 adds `open` back, with `--no-open` and `--stop`, and adds `install` with `--remove`; `init` and `dev` register the scheme by themselves. The server has the file, directory, state, events, screenshot and plugin-package routes, plus the hub routes when it runs as the launcher. The engine has `createGame` (split as in section 6), `nestedAssets`, the format parsers, `registerScripts`, the import map with the plugin mapping, `serializeSceneGltf` with the canonical helpers, `fileTypes`, and the plugins. The public API game projects rely on stays: `createGame` and its options, `main({viewer})`, `registerScripts`, `serializeSceneGltf`, the parsers and types, `createProjectAssetURLModifier`, `HtmlUiComponent`, `CannonPhysicsPlugin` and its components.

The engine's authoring metadata API, the runtime-object ownership helper the old guide described, stays deleted with the rest of the check feature. The terminator project uses it and migrates on its side; the list of what it must change lives with terminator's own notes, not here, per the rule in section 0.

- [x] Accept section 12 (accepted 2026-09-14)
- [x] No authoring API comes back; terminator migrates (decided 2026-09-14).

## 13. The guide

`docs/agents.md` is 1,000 lines. 908 of them describe the project format and the engine, mostly upstream's own text, and they stay. The 92 lines of editor and CLI text become one short section: `npx kite3d init`, `npx kite3d dev`, `npx kite3d open`, `npx kite3d screenshot`, `npx kite3d skills`, `npx kite3d publish` prints the skill; the token rule; the `.kite3d/` folder and `~/.kite3d/`. The `data-testid` list and the route list go.

                                              step 7  section 13 guide; prove it on this Mac end to end;
                                                      force-push over blitzdotdev/kite3d main;
                                                      0.20.0-alpha.1 on next; terminator migrates;
                                                      then 0.20.0 on latest
```

Each step is one codex pass at medium with the pr-skill section, manual headless evidence with screenshots I view myself, no proactive tests, one squash commit on `main`.

- [x] Accept the order (accepted 2026-09-14)
- [x] No 0.19.0-alpha.3. The old repository's `main` has the cleanup (#30) but no release carries it; `next` still points at alpha.2 from before it. A release from there would have let terminator try the cleaned CLI early. Since terminator migrates once, to 0.20.0, that release has no reader. Skipped (2026-09-14).

## 15. What is not happening

No mesh editing in the browser; Blender stays the editor, and the round trip through the watcher is what section 4 already gives you. No tabs and no stage yet; the document-and-stage design note stands and lands after this rewrite, on the upstream manager shape, which is the shape it was written for. No new tests; the three ported guards are tests of reported bugs. No new features beyond the six fixes and the picker with its URL scheme. No hosted picker on `kite3d.dev` yet. No push until it works locally.

## 16. Numbers to expect

Upstream `src` is 27,201 lines; after section 3 about 23,000. New editor code: about 250 lines for the transport and the handles, about 100 for the bootstrap and the event listener, about 60 for the loader, about 90 for the screenshot capture, the ported fixes at about 400, and the picker's four pieces at about 500 written fresh. kite3d after the cleanup: 1,504 lines of source, plus about 600 written fresh for the index, the launcher and the hub routes, and about 120 for `install` and its three registrations. Engine: 4,613, of which about 4,100 are upstream's plugins. Against the tree we are leaving: an editor of 24,000 lines with 80 percent suspect, a CLI package of 10,247 with 80 percent suspect, an engine of 6,667 with 20 percent suspect.
